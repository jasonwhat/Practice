# Practice Uncover

![Practice Uncover Theme Demo](https://github.com/jasonwhat/Practice/blob/master/preview.gif)
<br/>
This theme is for use on [uncover.fyi](https://uncover.fyi)
<br>
This is a fork of [Practice](https://github.com/Dennis-Mayk/Practice), a clean timeline theme for the [Ghost CMS](http://ghost.org).
This theme has been build from the ground up with a focus on only the most essential elements to keep the user experience smooth and fast.

## Installation
Just download an instance of <b>Practice Uncover</b> to your ghost's theme folder (you eventually will need to restart ghost). You can grab zip files of the first [alpha release v.0.0.2](https://github.com/jasonwhat/Practice/releases/tag/v0.0.2)

Please select an even number of posts per page in the pagination settings in your ghost dashboard for perfect pagination performance.

## Key changes from original
- The timeline defaults to one column, similar to mobile view. This was achieved by changing the @media screen max-width to 1700px, everything below that will render one column.
- Used Jquery and Js to only show first to paragraphs of each post on homepage unless they have internal tags #ad, #expand, or #feature. The latter only shows an excerpt.
- Updated colors
- Changed font to Merriweather for text and Raleway for H tags
- Inserted AddThis for sharing functionality, including on the homepage
- Added tag.description the tag pages

## Colors
- Emerald #18CD81
- Sky Blue #51D1EB
- Gulf Blue #141B57
- Moody Blue #7A72CF
